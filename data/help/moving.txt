To get into Cyberspace, you first jack-in (using the "jack" command).

To move around the net you use the movement commands "north", "south",
"east" and "west" (north=up, south=down, east=right, west=left). You
can abbreviate them to a single letter (N,S,E,W) if you like.

You can also use the "Number Pad" to move around: 8=North, 2=South,
6=East, 4=West)

To exit Cyberspace, jack-out (again, using the "jack" command).
